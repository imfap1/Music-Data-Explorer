# Requirements/Libraries Used
Here is an updated list of the primary dependencies used in your project:

pandas: This library is fundamental for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are used extensively in your project.

spotipy: Spotipy is a Python library for accessing Spotify's Web API. It allows you to retrieve data from Spotify, such as track information and artist details.

SpotifyClientCredentials: This is a module from the Spotipy library that provides a way to set up Spotify API credentials. It enables you to authenticate and make requests to the Spotify Web API.

matplotlib.pyplot: This library is used for creating various types of plots and charts, such as bar plots and scatter plots. It's one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in the Python ecosystem.

seaborn: Seaborn is a data visualization library that enhances the aesthetics of your plots created with Matplotlib. It simplifies many common data visualization tasks and improves the visual appeal of your charts.

plotly.express: Plotly Express is a high-level data visualization library that makes it easy to create interactive plots, such as pie charts and bar plots, with minimal code. It's excellent for creating visually appealing and interactive visualizations.

These libraries provide the core functionality for retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing Spotify data in your project. Make sure to have them installed, and you're ready to explore and analyze your music data.

# Hipothesis
-1 Explicit Songs Proportion

-2 Top Song Popularity by Country

-3 Danceability and Energy Variation by Country

-4 Dominant Artists in the Playlist


# Analysis
## Hypothesis 1: Explicit Songs Proportion

Null Hypothesis (H0): The percentage of explicit songs in the playlist is equal to the percentage of non-explicit songs.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The percentage of explicit songs in the playlist is different from the percentage of non-explicit songs.

Explanation:

This hypothesis explores whether there's a significant difference in the proportion of songs with explicit content compared to non-explicit songs within the playlist. If the alternative hypothesis is supported, it suggests that explicit songs have a distinct presence, affecting the overall playlist composition.

## Hypothesis 2: Top Song Popularity by Country

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the popularity of the top songs among different countries.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The popularity of the top songs varies significantly across different countries.

Explanation:

This hypothesis aims to investigate whether the popularity of the top songs within the playlist differs significantly between various countries. If the alternative hypothesis is supported, it suggests that certain countries may have a preference for specific songs, potentially due to cultural or regional factors impacting music preferences.

## Hypothesis 3: Danceability and Energy Variation by Country

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average danceability and energy scores of songs from different countries are not significantly different.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant variation in the average danceability and energy scores of songs from different countries.

Explanation:

This hypothesis seeks to investigate whether there exists a substantial variation in the average danceability and energy scores of songs, taking into account their country of origin. The alternative hypothesis suggests that music from various countries may exhibit distinct patterns in terms of danceability and energy. This could be indicative of cultural or regional influences on musical styles, potentially impacting the overall characteristics of songs.

## Hypothesis 4: Dominant Artists in the Playlist

Null Hypothesis (H0): The distribution of artists in the playlist is uniform, with no specific artist dominating.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There are a few dominant artists who significantly contribute to the playlist, while most artists have minimal representation.

Explanation:

This hypothesis aims to uncover the presence of dominant artists within the playlist data. The alternative hypothesis suggests that a small group of artists may significantly contribute to the playlist, potentially indicating a preference for certain artists or genres among the audience. Conversely, the null hypothesis assumes an even distribution of artists with no distinct dominance. This analysis can provide insights into the diversity or focus of the music selection.

# Conclusion:

In this project, we have explored various aspects of a Spotify playlist using a combination of data analysis and data visualization techniques. The project aimed to gain insights into the characteristics of the songs, artists, and countries represented in the playlist. Here are the key findings:

Explicit Songs Proportion: The analysis of explicit vs. non-explicit songs revealed that a significant proportion of songs in the playlist are non-explicit, suggesting that the playlist caters to a diverse audience.

Top Songs by Country: The identification of the top songs by country based on popularity provided a glimpse into the preferences of listeners in different regions, showcasing variations in song choices.

Average Danceability and Energy: The examination of danceability and energy scores by country highlighted differences in the musical attributes of songs preferred by various countries.

Dominant Artists: The analysis of top artists indicated the presence of dominant artists who had a substantial number of songs in the playlist, potentially reflecting the popularity of specific artists among listeners.

Overall, the project demonstrated the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering patterns and trends within a Spotify playlist. These findings can be valuable for playlist curators, music enthusiasts, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of music preferences in different regions.
